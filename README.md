# JDS - Joint Downloading System
JDS is a content downloader that downloads and splits the downloaded files into partitions, the partitioned files are then processed to the group of users that
requested the downloaded content for offline sharing.

Joint Downloading System, in short JDS is a system that utilizes powerful servers to download files from a given source or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and 
stores the file in the servers web disk or cloud storage the server-side logic then reconstructs the files, zips and splits the file into various chunks with 
a unique file size and labelling, the system then generates access code to enable the user who made the request share the access group code to his or her friends 
to help with downloading different chunks of the file that was requested by the user, with an access code all chunks can be downloaded manually or automatically 
through the Joint Downloading System application or website, the user will be able to either use a decompression tool to merge and unzip the chunks or use the 
most recommended means of merging and unzipping the chunks that were downloaded which is the JDS application (Joint Downloading System application).
